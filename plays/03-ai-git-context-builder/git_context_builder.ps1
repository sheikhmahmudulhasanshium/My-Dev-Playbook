.SYNOPSIS
  An AI-powered Git Context Builder that creates a comprehensive, AI-ready prompt file
  to get a human-like summary of your uncommitted changes.

.DESCRIPTION
  Play #3 from My-Dev-Playbook. This script solves the problem of understanding complex changes
  by preparing a perfect "context package" for a Large Language Model (LLM). It combines the
  directory structure, the code differences (diff), and your stated goal into a single text file.
  You can then paste this into any AI chat to get a high-quality explanation of your work.
