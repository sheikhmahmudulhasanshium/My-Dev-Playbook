## üéØ About This Playbook

In the day-to-day life of a developer, we often encounter small, repetitive tasks that consume valuable time and energy. This repository is my personal playbook for tackling those challenges‚Äîa curated set of proven, simple, and effective scripts that I frequently use to get the job done faster.

The goal is not to reinvent the wheel, but to have a reliable, go-to resource of pragmatic solutions for real-world problems.

## üéÆ The Plays

Here are the currently available "plays" in the playbook. Each one is designed to solve a specific problem.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play #1: The Simple File Merger

A lightweight yet powerful script to find all files of a specific type (e.g., `.ts`, `.js`, `.css`) within a directory and its subdirectories, and combine them into a single output file.

#### ‚ú® Key Features:
-   **üîÑ Recursive Search:** Automatically finds files in all subfolders.
-   **üìù Traceable Output:** Prepends each file's content with a comment containing its original relative path.
-   **üìÇ Preserves Content:** Faithfully copies all content, including comments (`//`, `/**/`) and formatting.
-   **üîå Dependency-Free:** Runs natively on Windows using PowerShell or a standard Batch file.

#### üìÅ Files:
-   **PowerShell Version:** [`merge_files.ps1`](./plays/01-file-merger/merge_files.ps1)
-   **Batch File Version:** [`merge_files.bat`](./plays/01-file-merger/merge_files.bat)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play #2: The Advanced File Merger

An intelligent, interactive script that analyzes a project directory and guides you through merging only the files you need. It's perfect for creating a comprehensive "context dump" for AI models, project archiving, or code reviews.

#### ‚ú® Key Features:
-   **üìä Project Analysis:** Starts with a summary of file types and the heaviest folders.
-   **ü§ñ Smart Filtering:** Interactively suggests ignoring common folders like `node_modules` and automatically respects rules from your `.gitignore` file.
-   **üéØ User-Controlled Selection:** You have the final say on which file extensions to include.
-   **üìÑ Formatted Markdown Output:** Creates a clean, human-readable `.md` file that can easily be converted to PDF or DOCX.

#### üìÅ File:
-   **PowerShell Version:** [`merge_files_advanced.ps1`](./plays/02-file-merger-advanced/merge_files_advanced.ps1)

#### üìù A Note on Tooling:
> **Why is there no `.bat` version for this play?**
>
> The advanced features of this script‚Äîsuch as interactive prompts, file system analysis, and parsing `.gitignore` files‚Äîrely heavily on capabilities that are native to PowerShell. Creating an equivalent in a traditional Batch file would be extremely complex, slow, and unreliable. This is a great example of choosing the right tool for the job, and for this task, PowerShell is the clear and superior choice.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use The Plays

Each script is self-contained and ready to use.

### Option A: PowerShell (Recommended for all plays)
1.  Navigate to the directory of the play you wish to use (e.g., `./plays/02-file-merger-advanced/`).
2.  Hold down `Shift` + `Right-Click` on an empty space and select **"Open PowerShell window here"**.
3.  Execute the script by typing its name and pressing Enter. For example: `.\merge_files_advanced.ps1`
4.  Follow any on-screen instructions.

### Option B: Windows Batch File (For simple plays like Play #1)
1.  Copy the desired `.bat` file (e.g., `merge_files.bat`) into the project folder you want to run it in.
2.  Double-click the `.bat` file to execute it.
3.  A command window will open, run the script, and close automatically.

## üöÄ Future Vision

This playbook is a living project. I plan to continuously add new scripts and utilities as I develop solutions for new challenges. The long-term vision is to potentially evolve some of these utilities into a user-friendly web-based application.
